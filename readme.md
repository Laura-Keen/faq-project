# FAQ Page - InkTrap

## Task 
____

We've been asked to build an FAQ page as part of a larger website. The page features questions that expand to show an answer when clicked, as well as a header and footer.

All content on the page will eventually come from a Content Management System, meaning its length and composition may be varied.

The page needs to deliver an excellent experience for all users, across both mobile and desktop devices.

## Notes
____

- You can use any HTML or CSS techniques you like to build the page.

- Avoid using front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, or application frameworks like React and Vue.

- The design doesn't include hover/focus states for interactive elements. Include these as you see fit.

- The design doesn't include mobile versions of the screens. Adapt the design while coding to provide an appropriate experience on smaller devices.

- Weâ€™ll be reviewing the page in Google Chrome on macOS and Safari on iOS. No other browser testing is required.
